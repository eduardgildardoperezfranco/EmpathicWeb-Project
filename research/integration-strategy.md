# Website Integration Strategy

This document outlines a strategy for integrating the best features from the researched websites (corvicac.org, ipervolas.com, and maka.marketing) into the EmpathicWeb project.

## 1. New "Projects" Section

Inspired by the project showcases on all three websites, we recommend creating a new, visually-driven "Projects" or "Portfolio" section. This section will replace the current `Projects/projects.html` page and will feature:

*   **A grid-based layout:** Displaying each project with a high-quality image and a brief description.
*   **Detailed project pages:** Each project in the grid will link to a detailed page with more information, images, and a description of the work done.
*   **Clear categorization:** Projects should be categorized to allow users to easily filter and find relevant work.

## 2. Enhanced Call-to-Action (CTA)

Integrate prominent and clear call-to-action buttons throughout the website. This is inspired by the effective CTAs on `corvicac.org`. We recommend:

*   A primary CTA in the hero section of the homepage, such as "View Our Work" or "Get in Touch."
*   Secondary CTAs at the end of each project page and on the "About Us" page.

## 3. Testimonials Section

Add a "Testimonials" section to build credibility and trust. This section will feature quotes from satisfied clients, similar to the "Testimonios" section on `corvicac.org`.

## 4. "About Us" Page Enhancement

Expand the existing `about/about.html` page to be more comprehensive and engaging. This can include:

*   **Team introductions:** Introduce the team with photos and brief bios.
*   **Company values and mission:** Clearly articulate the values and mission of EmpathicWeb.
*   **Behind-the-scenes content:** Share photos or stories that give a glimpse into the company culture.

## 5. Blog/News Section

Create a new "Blog" or "News" section to share industry insights, company updates, and other relevant content. This will help to:

*   **Improve SEO:** Regularly updated content can improve search engine rankings.
*   **Establish authority:** Position EmpathicWeb as an expert in the field.
*   **Engage with the audience:** Provide valuable content that will keep users coming back to the site.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Create a new `portfolio.html` page:** This will be the main page for the new "Projects" section.
2.  **Create a template for individual project pages.**
3.  **Update the navigation menu** to include links to the new "Portfolio" and "Blog" sections.
4.  **Redesign the `about/about.html` page.**
5.  **Create a new `blog.html` page** and a template for individual blog posts.
